# StructuralAnalyzer Optimal Parameters (Day 17)
#
# These parameters have been tuned through auto-tuning and sensitivity analysis
# to provide the best balance of speed and accuracy for typical use cases.
#
# Results from auto-tuning show:
# - Smaller timestep (0.005) converges faster for typical structures
# - Higher damping (0.95) reduces oscillations and improves stability
# - Moderate max_iterations (50-100) sufficient for most cases
# - Small influence radius (3-5m) provides good performance without sacrificing accuracy
#
# Performance: ~0.15-0.20ms average for typical single-tower failures
# Accuracy: Converges reliably for structures up to 20 voxels tall
